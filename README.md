# 30 Days of Python

As a web developer fiddling around with JavaScript most of the time, I wanted to explore the territories of a different language and document the learning journey in the process. I decided to learn Python, one of the most loved and popular languages, something which had been in my wishlist for a while. It would be really nice I believe to explore the new possibilities that Python is so widely recognized for such as Data Science, Machine Learning etc.

I decided to split the learning roadmap in 4 weeks with each week dedicated to learning some specific areas of the language. As a developer, I know it is quite impossible to master a language in such a short span but a daily deliberate practice routine for the same duration is sufficient to start building interesting projects and build the foundations.

## The Roadmap

- Week 1 - Python fundamentals, basic syntax, setting up the developer environment, basic working principle, practice some basic coding and document the process.

- Week 2 - Programming Paradigms â†’ Object-Oriented and Functional Programming Patterns.

- Week 3 - Python Decorators, Error Handling, Modules, Generators, Debugging.

- Week 4 - File I/O, Regular Expressions, Testing, Scripting using Python.

- Extras(Based on time availability): Data Scraping, Server Setup, Machine Learning Basics.

Documenting my daily progress would help me build a reference journal for future reference as well. I hope can act

as a helpful resource to anyone looking to learn the language as well ðŸ™‚
